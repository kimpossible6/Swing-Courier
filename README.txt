Special Information:
Version: Java 8
How to use: java -jar courier.jar
Also created photo and calendar tabs

Bonus Point:
1. Added addition $1 Gestures to change color of stroke, details see the img folder

2. Implement richer commands: 
Added 4 $1 gestures in addition to the required gestures
including: zig-zag(for color panel), V (for oval radio button), R (for rectangle radio button), square (for text radio button). 

3. Instead of having a customized color panel from last homework, I implemented a JColorChooser panel that user could use simple gesture to access it.

4. Gratuitous graphical richness: opaque effects in elements of the selection box



Note: 
The application seems slow after doing text typing. If the jar frozen, please reopen it or click some other radio buttons.

How to move the object? (This is a very special process, please use this way to test the app) 
1. After draw the loop, if you see the status bar at bottom says "Select", right click the mouse (button 3), you will see a red rectangle
2. Press your left button (button1) of the mouse with in the rectangle, drag with your left button to the place you desire. 
3. Click Button 3 again, the objects will display at that spot. 
4. To exit the selection mode, your need to press your button 2(the middle button of your mouse)
